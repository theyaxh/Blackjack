This is a source code of Popular Casino card game Blackjack in which the sum of your cards should be closer to 21 without getting over 21, if you go over 21, You lose!
Players have a option to choose the value of their Ace cards as 11 or 1. The values of Jack, Queen and King is set to 10. If Yours and Computerâ€™s cards sum is same,
that will be a draw.

The starting and ending of the program is handled by the main function while the core logic of the game is handled by the play function and its subfunctions.
misc and welcome_screen are nothing but to add a fancy touch to the code at the runtime.
Stack_implementation deals with the push and popping of the cards from the stack of cards, stack is used as this was a project in my college for data structure 
subject and had to use a data structure in the project. Alternative for this is just taking the cards from the deck array directly.

Thankyou for reading, hope you enjoy the game!
